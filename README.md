# toponets

A simple interface to load checkpoints from the [TopoNets Paper](https://toponets.github.io) (ICLR 2025). We closely followed the standard training procedures for these models. The only difference being the addition of [topoloss](https://github.com/toponets/topoloss) to the original loss.

All of the checkpoints are hosted on the [MurtyLab HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/murtylab) ðŸ¤— 

Start by installing this repo as a module:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/toponets/toponets.git
```

Then load the pre-trained checkpoints like this:

```python
import toponets

tau = 10.0  # Choose a supported tau value for the selected model

topo_resnet18 = toponets.resnet18(tau=tau, checkpoint_path=f"resnet18_tau_{tau}.pt")  # Supported taus: [0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0]
topo_resnet50 = toponets.resnet50(tau=tau, checkpoint_path=f"resnet50_tau_{tau}.pt")  # Supported taus: [30.0]
topo_vit_b_32 = toponets.vit_b_32(tau=tau, checkpoint_path=f"vit_b_32_tau_{tau}.pt")  # Supported taus: [10.0]
topo_nanogpt = toponets.nanogpt(tau=tau, checkpoint_path=f"nanogpt_tau_{tau}.pt")  # Supported taus: [0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 50.0]
```
